                    Hi there! I'm Gabriela but prefer to be called Gabi. I was born in Poland, raised in New Jersey and somehow ended up in Brooklyn. I've decided to take the Full Stack Bootcamp course to finally do something for myself and expand on my creativity. Hopefully one day it will all click and I will be able to find a career that fits me.

                 I enjoy a good cup of coffee, hiking, painting, reading, listening to music. I'm absolutely in love with my dog. Don't know what I would do without her.
